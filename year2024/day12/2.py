"""
instead of counting perimeter edges, track points that this cell contributes to
tracing the perimeter of the region.  In the A region here, the top left A has three 
points for its top left, top right, and bottom left.

  AA
  AA

These perimeter points are stored with the direction for the side of the cell.

for the region, throw out any vertices that are doubled up when counting this
way; those are points not on the endpoints of the face, e.g.

  [ A1 ][ A2 ]

along the top, A1's right top point is shared with A2's left top point, and this
get counted twice => it is not a vertex of the region's polygon

once a region is pared down to its essential vertices, the number of edges is
equal to the number of vertices
