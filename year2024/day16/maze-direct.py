""" 
build a directed networkx graph, where each cell has four vertices, one for each
direction and with weight 1000 between them, and edges between adjacent cells
with weight 1

use it to find the shortest paths to solve the puzzles

this one creates the graph directly, instead of parsing into data structures first.  This is
about 20% faster, but both are about 1s for this problem's input
