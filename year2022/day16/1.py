"""
big idea

draw this as a graph, where each valve vertex, and at a vertex you can stay there to open it

weights between edges are 1, the time to travel between them / open the valve

each vertex has a value, the flow rate * (MAX_STEPS - steps taken)

The given valves (say, XX) are called XX_closed.  The open version of the valve is called XX_open.

Map out the graph, then keep state as a tuple of which valves are open so that they can be
passed around in recursion
